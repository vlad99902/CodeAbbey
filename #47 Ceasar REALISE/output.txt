TO US IN OLDEN STORIES.
CARTHAGE MUST BE DESTROYED LET HIM THROW THE FIRST STONE.
FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO GIVE YOUR ROOKS BUT NOT DILARAM IN ANCIENT PERSIA THERE WAS A KING.
ARE WONDERS MANY TOLD.
THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING GREENFIELDS ARE GONE NOW.
WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER A DAY AT THE RACES.
MET A WOMAN AT THE WELL AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS.
